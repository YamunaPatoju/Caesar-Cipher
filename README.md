# Caesar-Cipher
CAESAR CIPHER
This Python program allows you to encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.The user is prompted to either encode or decode a message.
2.The program takes in the message and the number of shifts (called the shift amount).
3.Each letter of the message is shifted by the specified amount in the alphabet.
-If encoding, letters shift forward.
-If decoding, letters shift backward.
4.Non-alphabet characters are ignored and left unchanged.
5.The program loops, allowing the user to encrypt or decrypt additional messages.

FEATURES:
-Encoding: Encrypt your message by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
-Decoding: Decrypt an encrypted message by shifting letters backward.
-Multiple Attempts: The user can encode or decode multiple messages in a single session.
